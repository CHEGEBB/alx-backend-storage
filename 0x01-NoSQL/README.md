# MySQL Advanced Project üöÄ

Welcome to the MySQL Advanced Project! In this project, you will explore advanced features of MySQL, including creating tables with constraints, optimizing queries with indexes, and implementing stored procedures, functions, views, and triggers. 

## Learning Objectives üéØ

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain and implement the following concepts:

- **Creating Tables with Constraints**: Learn how to define primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and more.
- **Optimizing Queries with Indexes**: Understand how to improve query performance by adding indexes.
- **Stored Procedures and Functions**: Learn how to create and use stored procedures and functions to encapsulate business logic.
- **Views**: Understand how to create and use views to simplify complex queries.
- **Triggers**: Learn how to implement triggers to automatically execute actions based on specific events.

## Requirements ‚úÖ

- All your files will be executed on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** using **MySQL 5.7** (version 5.7.30).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- All your SQL queries should have a comment just before (i.e., syntax above).
- All your files should start with a comment describing the task.
- All SQL keywords should be in uppercase (e.g., `SELECT`, `WHERE`).
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

### Use ‚Äúcontainer-on-demand‚Äù to run MySQL üê≥

1. **Request a container**: Ubuntu 18.04 - Python 3.7
2. **Connect via SSH** or **WebTerminal**.
3. **Start MySQL** before working with it.

### Example of SQL File with Comments üìù

```sql
-- 3 first students in the Batch ID=3
-- because Batch 3 is the best!
SELECT id, name FROM students WHERE batch_id = 3 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 3;
```

## Project Tasks üìã

1. **Create Tables with Constraints**
   - Task: Create a table with primary key, foreign key, and unique constraints.
   - File: `1-create_tables.sql`

2. **Optimize Queries with Indexes**
   - Task: Add indexes to existing tables to improve query performance.
   - File: `2-optimize_queries.sql`

3. **Stored Procedures and Functions**
   - Task: Create and use stored procedures and functions.
   - File: `3-stored_procedures.sql`

4. **Views**
   - Task: Create and use views to simplify complex queries.
   - File: `4-views.sql`

5. **Triggers**
   - Task: Implement triggers to automate actions based on specific events.
   - File: `5-triggers.sql`

## Tips and Tricks üí°

- Always test your SQL queries in a safe environment before running them in production.
- Make use of MySQL documentation to understand the syntax and best practices.
- Comment your SQL code for better readability and maintenance.

## Conclusion üéâ

This project is designed to deepen your understanding of MySQL's advanced features. By completing these tasks, you'll gain practical experience that will be valuable for any database-related work. Good luck and happy coding!
